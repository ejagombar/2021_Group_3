The aim of this project is described below. As stated in the task sheet. Your team has been asked by a client to develop and 3D model viewer that will form part of a larger C\+AD system ~\newline

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The client needs software that can run on P\+Cs running Windows, Mac\+OS and Linux ~\newline

\item Your group only needs to develop for 1 of these but you are free to use any platform you choose. ~\newline

\item It must be able to visualise models in two formats\+: ~\newline

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The standard S\+TL format ~\newline

\item A proprietary “in-\/house” format that was used for their old products. You will write a 3D \mbox{\hyperlink{class_model}{Model}} Viewer application and deliver it in package/installer. ~\newline

\end{DoxyItemize}
\item In semester 1 you’ll need to write a custom library (more on this later) to allow it load the in-\/house model format ~\newline

\item The \mbox{\hyperlink{class_model}{Model}} Viewer itself will be developed in semester 2. ~\newline

\item You must provide a report outlining how the software was developed, how the code is structured, and how the software can be operated.
\item Source code for both the library and viewer must also be submitted for assessment ~\newline
