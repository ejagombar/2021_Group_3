## Task
The aim of this project is described below. As stated in the task sheet.
Your team has been asked by a client to develop and 3D model viewer that will form part of a larger CAD system  
  * The client needs software that can run on PCs running Windows, MacOS and Linux  
  * Your group only needs to develop for 1 of these but you are free to use any platform you choose.   
  * It must be able to visualise models in two formats:  
    * The standard STL format  
    * A proprietary “in-house” format that was used for their old products.
You will write a 3D Model Viewer application and deliver it in package/installer.  
  * In semester 1 you’ll need to write a custom library (more on this later) to allow it load the in-house model format  
  * The Model Viewer itself will be developed in semester 2.  
  * You must provide a report outlining how the software was developed, how the code is structured, and how the software can be operated.
  * Source code for both the library and viewer must also be submitted for assessment
